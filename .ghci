-- 
-- This is taken from doctests's doctests:
--
:set -DTEST -isrc -itests -idist/build/autogen -packageghc

--
-- You may want to enable this (for doctest convenience):
--
-- :set prompt "\n|\n>>>"
-- 
-- The reason this might be useful, is that you could copy/paste your ghci
--    session into a file you're editing, and (except for commenting)
--    it will already be in a format which doctest will check for you.
--
-- In order to comment it out, use the regular expression:
--    
--    s/^/-- /
--  
-- on the newly added lines.
--
-- In practical terms, this means you can run some expressions in ghci,
--    paste your session into a doctested source (.hs) file, and you will
--    be alerted in the future should the evaluation of that expression
--    ever change.


-- These the ones suggested by jfischoff, commented:
:set -i./src -i./tests
:set -package transformers-0.2.2.0 
:set -package mtl-2.0.1.0
:load Main

-- I expect these shouldn't ever be necessary?
-- I needed this
